00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.880
Imagine you're a project manager and you

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.600
need to coordinate with teams that speak

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.960
different different languages with

4
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.520
respect to their work. Now imagine having

5
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.520
a universal translator that lets you say,

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.760
create a user dashboard in plain English

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.880
and it automatically translates your

8
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.400
request into each team's specialized

9
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.040
language. Without this translator, you

10
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.240
need to learn four different technical

11
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.840
languages. This is what Model Context

12
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.800
Protocol or MCP is all about. With MCP,

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.920
you speak human language once and it

14
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.360
handles all the technical. Technical

15
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.320
translation automatically. So basically

16
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.480
MCP standardizes this translation layer

17
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.120
so AI agents or LLMS can seamlessly talk

18
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.080
to databases, APIs, cloud services

19
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.240
and any other system without developers

20
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.240
having to build custom integrations for

21
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.080
each one of them.
